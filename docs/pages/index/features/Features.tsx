              <h3>Less easy, but simpler</h3>
              <p>
                With <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> you integrate tools yourself. This usually means more work and it's
                less easy; getting started is often slower.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the black box nature of frameworks like Next.js/Nuxt is limiting and requires brittle workarounds.
                In the end, you waste time fighting the framework.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast, <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> is transparent: it gets out of your way and integrating tools
                is simply a matter of following the tool's official installation guide.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a nutshell: <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> is less easy, but simpler.
              </p>
              <h3>Stable foundation</h3>
              <p>
                Frameworks need to constantly keep up with the ecosystem, whereas do-one-thing-do-it-well tools can
                quickly stabilize.
              </p>
              <p>
                Actually, <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> is already stable: breaking changes are only about improving the
                design of <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> which means that you can expect your integrations to keep working
                in the future.
              </p>
              <h3>Clean cut</h3>
              <p>
                There is no conflation between <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> and your UI framework (React/Vue/...). This
                makes reasoning about your app a lot easier.
              </p>
              <h3>Fun</h3>
              <p>
                Last but not least, manual integration is fun & insightful! (Whereas fighting a framework is unnecessary
                & pesky.)

              <h3>Lazy-transpiling</h3>
              <p>
                One of Vite's foundational novelty is lazy-transpiled development: instead of transpiling your entire
                codebase before starting developing, Vite transpiles only loaded code.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if you define 100 pages and then open a page in the browser, then only the code for that
                one page is transpiled while the code for all other 99 pages is left untouched.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to lazy-transpiling, you can scale to a (very) large codebase while keeping fast HMR &
                development start.
              </p>
              <h3>No black box</h3>
              <p>At scale, Next.js/Nuxt's black-box nature become painfully limiting.</p>
              <p>
                In contrast, <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> is transparent: you keep control over both the server- and
                browser-side.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you scale, you usually need increasingly custom SSR integrations; <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code>'s
                flexibility accommodates such needs.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Vite + SSR + Scale = <Emoji name="red-heart" />
              </h3>
              <p>
                At (very) large scale, you can progressively replace <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> with Vite's native SSR
                API which is lower-level and highly flexible. If you're Netflix and perfecting UX leads to a substantial
                revenue increase, then <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> and Vite's native SSR API are what you are looking
                for.

              <p>
                The browser-side of each page loads only the code it needs, while sharing common chunks between pages
                for optimal cacheability. Powered by Rollup <RollupLogo />.
              </p>
              <h3>Client Routing</h3>
              <p>
                Upon page navigation, instead of loading and rendering the next page on both the server-side and
                browser-side, the next page is loaded & rendered only on the browser-side.
              </p>
              <h3>Link Prefetching</h3>
              <p>You can preload links for instantaneous page navigation.</p>
              <h3>Fast Cold Starts</h3>
              <p>
                On the server-side, pages are as well lazy-loaded: adding pages doesn't increase the cold start of your
                (serverless) deployment.
