Usually, we define [`onBeforeRender()` in `.page.server.js`](/onBeforeRender)
but, if we use [Client Routing](/clientRouting),
then we also have the option to define `onBeforeRender()` in `.page.js` instead.

When defined in `.page.server.js` the `onBeforeRender()` hook is only loaded & executed in Node.js,
whereas if we define it in `.page.js` then `onBeforeRender()` is also loaded & executed in the browser:
for the first page the user visits `onBeforeRender()` is called in Node.js
while for any subsequent page navigation `onBeforeRender()` is called in the browser.

Examples:
- <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/star-wars/%40id.page.tsx' />
- <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/star-wars/movie/index.page.vue' />

## Recommendation

In general, we recommend defining `onBeforeRender()` hooks in `.page.server.js` since it's easier to write code that only runs
in Node.js.

That said, if we want to minimize requests made to our Node.js server, then we may want to define our `onBeforeRender()` hooks in `.page.js`.
But then we need to ensure that our `onBeforeRender()` hook is isomorphic: it needs to be able to run in both Node.js and the browser.

## Server Routing

If we use <Link href="/server-routing" noBreadcrumb={true} /> we shouldn't define `onBeforeRender()` in `.page.js`
(the browser loads `onBeforeRender()` but never calls it). We should always define [`onBeforeRender()` in `.page.server.js`](/onBeforeRender) instead.
