import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

When you deploy a new version, then your user's client-side automatically transitions to the new deployed version when the user navigates to a new page.

It works automatically and there is nothing for you to do.

> **How does it work?**
>
> A problem with <Link text="Client Routing" href="/client-routing" /> is that users can have long-lived outdated clients.
>
> To mitigate the problem, vite-plugin-ssr falls back temporarily to <Link text="Server Routing" href="/server-routing" /> whenever retrieving a static asset returns a `404`: all static asset URLs contain a unique hash and, consequently, when the user natvigates to a new page then the old client requests asset URLs that don't exist anymore. This means that the new page is loaded with Server Routing and the entire client-side is reloaded. After the reload Client Routing is resumed.
>
> Note that, since the client-side is reloaded, any potential client-only state is lost if not persisted (to local storage, for instance).
>
> So far, this technique has shown to be reliable, but if it doesn't work for you, then open a new GitHub issue.
